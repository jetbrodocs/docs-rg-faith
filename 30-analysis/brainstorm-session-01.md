## Part 1: Page-by-Page Scan Analysis

### Page 1 — Packed Bales List for Month (December 2025)

**What it is:** A register page listing all bales packed during December 2025. Printed date is 02/01/2026. Page number marked as "0" (likely first page of a multi-page list).

**Key data:**
- Header says "Total Boles: 1296" and "Last Bales: 35301"
- 5-column table of bale numbers (handwritten)
- Bale numbers range roughly from ~13000s to ~44000s (not sequential — likely assigned across different products/orders)
- Footer says "130 Bales" — this page lists 130 out of 1296 total for the month

**Observations:**
- Bale number is a key tracking identifier in the system
- The numbering is NOT sequential within a single month, suggesting bale numbers are running serial numbers across the entire operation
- "Last Bales: 35301" could be the last bale number from the previous month
- The register is maintained manually

### Page 2 — Ready For Sending Reprocess List

**What it is:** A list of lots that are ready to be sent back for reprocessing. Mill name: "PSJC" (possibly P.S.J.C. or similar abbreviation).

**Columns:** MRL No | Avak Date | Lot Number | Quality | Tone | MTR | Remark

**Entries (what I can read):**
| MRL No | Avak Date | Lot No | Quality | Tone | MTR | Remark |
|--------|-----------|--------|---------|------|-----|--------|
| 526 | 9/6/24 | 691 | RC-8001 | O1W | 1408 | (Hindi remark — mentions some issue) |
| 826 | 11/8/25 | 1148 | Lancer W/R | Rust/BMQ 225 | — | (Hindi) |
| 1403 | 11/11/25 | 1035 | Liverpool | L-03 | V9850 | (Hindi — mentions discoloration?) |
| — | — | — | — | (arrows indicating continuation) | — | — |
| 1097 | 11/9/24 | 4020 | Unifoom | OAV | F13 | (Hindi remark) |
| — | — | — | — | (arrows) | — | — |
| 2392 | 6/13/25 | 69277 | PCW/MQ | O1W | 930 | (Hindi remark — mentions RUSS/something 250) |

**Date on form:** 19/01/26

**Observations:**
- "MRL No" appears frequently across scans — this is clearly a key identifier. Need clarification on what MRL stands for (Material Receipt Lot? Mill Receipt Log?)
- "Avak Date" is likely an arrival/receipt date (Avak = arrival in Hindi)
- Quality column has brand/product names: RC-8001, Lancer, Liverpool, Unifoom, PCW — these seem to be fabric quality/brand codes
- Tone column has color codes: O1W (likely Off-White), Rust/BMQ, L-03, OAV
- Remarks are in Hindi — would need translation for full context
- This form tracks material that failed QC and needs to go back to the dyeing mill — aligns with the "not acceptable" grade and conflict resolution process mentioned in notes

### Page 3 — Decision Pending Lots In Miroli

**What it is:** A list of lots sitting in "Miroli" (a location — likely a processing station or godown) awaiting a quality decision. Date: 9/01/26.

**Columns:** Same structure — MRL No | Avak Date | Lot Number | Quality | Tone | MTR | Remark

**Entries organized by mill:**
- **Kalapurna Mill:** MRL 1285 (14/10/25), Lot 6252, Quality: K790xx, 884 MTR
- **A.T.P. Mill:** MRL 1392 (3/13/25), Lot 1558, Quality: BHTS, Tone: Blue, 398 MTR — remark mentions "39 pieces" (Hindi)
- **PSJC Mill:** MRL 1092 (23/9/25), Lot 2108, Quality: Trend/TWill, Tone: OW, 246 MTR — remark mentions "manufacturing error/fault"
- **BKT Mill:** MRL 576 (18/6/24), Lot 1275, Quality: Supersonic, Tone: O1O, 972 MTR
- **Shaim Mill:** MRL 127 (19/4/25), Lot 4148, Quality: Supersonic A/U, Tone: 233, 34008 MTR — remark mentions "2 more"
- **Shyam Mill:** MRL 1574 (4/10/25), Lot 73940, Quality: Legendar, Tone: 1000, 598 MTR — "Font/Sel."
- Also MRL 1403 (11/11/25), Lot 1035, Quality: Liverpool, 223 MTR — "Font/Sel."
- **Shreeji Mill:** MRL 1805 (3/11/25), Lot 1223, Quality: KM11000, Tone: O1O, 3139 MTR — remark mentions "4071 QQT, Roto Bycm"

**Observations:**
- Multiple mills supply to RG Faith — Kalapurna, ATP, PSJC, BKT, Shaim, Shyam, Shreeji
- "Miroli" is a processing station or warehouse where incoming lots are staged before grading
- "Decision Pending" = quality grading not yet done
- MTR = meters (unit of measurement, confirmed by notes)
- "Font/Sel." likely means "Fent/Select" — a grading category
- Some lots have been sitting since mid-2024 — very long decision cycles

---

### Page 4 — Packed Bales Stock Report (Computer-Generated)

**What it is:** A **printed/computer-generated** stock report titled "Packed Bales Stock" dated 21/01/2026. Handwritten title at top says "Packed Bales Stock." This is from their existing software system.

**Columns:** Case No. | Location | Product | Gradation | Trade No | Pcs | Qty | Rate | Amount

**Key observations:**
- Location is consistently "Miroli Folding" — confirms Miroli is a processing/folding location
- Products include: Ecru-16, Butterscotch-58", Galaxy-58", WW-50", Uniform-58", Golden Glade, Strawberry Fortune, Eastend, Saybird, KT 11000, KT 11006, S8072-58", Casement, Polestar-58"
- Gradation types: Fresh, Fent, Rags, Cut (matches notes exactly)
- Trade numbers are product identifiers
- Rate and Amount columns are mostly 0.00 — possibly not yet valued or this is an inventory-only view
- This is **Page 1 of 40** — so there are 40 pages of packed bale stock
- Products have width specifications (58", 50", etc.)
- "Ecru" appears — this could be the undyed/natural color state

---

### Page 5 — Ready Goods Report (Handwritten)

**What it is:** A detailed handwritten "Ready Goods Report" dated 14/01/2026. This appears to be the grading/measurement form used after folding.

**Header data:**
- Item: 578A
- Le. No.: 836057/040/7014
- R.G. (party?): 45 Pcs
- Grey Mix: 9280
- Quality: 4428
- Re. Width: 89 cm (approx)
- Folding Mix: —
- Weight: 10/880
- Elongation / Shrinkage: 5-5.50
- Rea. Mix: 5657
- B. No.: 629 | B. No.: 6826 | — | B. No.: 626

**Body:** A grid with rows numbered 1-27, and multiple column groups (Sr. No., Grey Mts., Rea. Mts.) repeated across the page. Each row records piece-level measurements:
- Grey meters (before processing) vs Ready meters (after processing)
- Example: Row 1: 154, 1142; Row 2: 144, 64...
- Some entries show measurements like 150, 1445, 1199, etc.
- Notes at bottom: "Cathoy" (a fold type?), "Line 51049" references, "White M...Nine"

**Observations:**
- This is the core measurement and grading document
- Grey Mts vs Ready Mts tracks shrinkage from dyeing
- Multiple "B. No." (Book Numbers?) suggest multiple books/rolls in one lot
- The elongation/shrinkage values are critical quality parameters
- "45 Pcs" = 45 pieces in this lot
- This form is from the folding station — first point where actual measurement happens (aligns with notes)

### Page 6 — Fresh Pending Lots In Miroli 36" (Page 1)

**What it is:** A register of lots pending in Miroli that have been graded as "Fresh" (good quality). These are 36-inch width lots. Date: 19/01/26. Last MRL NO: 1975.

**Columns:** MRL No | Avak Date | Lot Number | Quality | Tone | MTR | Part Pending Mtr | Mill

**Sample entries:**
| MRL No | Avak Date | Lot No | Quality | Tone | MTR | Mill |
|--------|-----------|--------|---------|------|-----|------|
| 1805 | 26/11/25 | 52 | LV914 | O1W | 4130 | Om Shakthi |
| 1694 | 20/11/25 | 7458 | KT3000 | O1W | 5501 | Kalapurna |
| 1864 | 17/01/26 | 8090 | KT1V400 | O1W | 4194 | U |
| 1669 | — | 5931 | KT V000 | White | 1680 | — |
| 1696 | 05/11/26 | 7682 | NOV/Pitrav | O1W | 4196 | U |
| 1890 | 12/01/26 | 7890 | U | O1W | 3942 | U |
| 1764 | 09/11/25 | 7456 | Lancer | O1W | 3981 | U |
| 1852 | 15/01/26 | 7892 | Lancer | White | 2794 | U |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Observations:**
- 36" is a specific width category — there's likely a separate list for 58" and other widths
- Mill names visible: Om Shakthi, Kalapurna, and many marked "U" (unknown? or same mill?)
- Quality codes: LV914, KT3000, KT1V400, KTV000, Lancer, KT11000, Coolking
- "Part Pending Mtr" column — some lots are partially received, confirming the notes about partial shipments
- Dates reference 19/01/26 (current tracking date) with mills marked 19/01/26 in the Part Pending column
- Some entries reference "Shokeen" and "Kalapurna" mills specifically

---

### Page 7 — Fresh Pending Lots In Miroli 36" (Page 2, continuation)

**What it is:** Continuation of the previous page. Same format.

**Additional entries with MRL numbers from 1926 to 1968:**
- Quality codes continue: KT11000, Coolking (appears multiple times)
- Several lots from "Om Shakthi" and "Kalapurna" mills
- MTR values range from 130 to 5900+
- Some entries show dates in "Part Pending" column (19/01/26) indicating partial receipt

**Observations:**
- "Coolking" appears as a quality/brand name — appears to be a newer/recent arrival
- The register is quite full — significant inventory sitting in pending state

---

### Page 8 — Folding Meters Being Matched Against Factory Meters

**What it is:** A handwritten reconciliation notebook page. Title (in blue ink at top): "Folding meters being matched against factory meters."

**Content:**
- Header shows: 526, 45, 7915, and "S B" on the right
- Three columns of paired numbers (measurements)
- Left column examples: 188/138, 142/1425, 145/1460, 140/1415, 136/1360, 144/1430, 143/143, 187/1800, 136/138, 1025/144, etc.
- Middle column: 1437/147, 138/138, 143/144, 136/137, 144/1440, 144/1410, 149/145, 1440/145, 145/145, 142/143, 120/1200, 94/940, 640/640, 64/65, 23/23, 14/14
- Right column: 136/139, 144/144, 144/144, 144/144, 142/144, 143/144
- A circled "5150" appears in the middle — possibly a total
- Bottom shows "1691" — possibly another total

**Observations:**
- This is the QC reconciliation step — folding meters vs factory meters
- The paired numbers show slight discrepancies (e.g., 188 vs 138, 142 vs 1425)
- This process verifies that what the mill claims to have sent matches what RG Faith actually measures after folding
- The discrepancy tracking is manual — potential for errors
- "526" at top could be MRL No 526 (same lot referenced in Page 2's reprocess list)
- Critical data point: measurement discrepancies lead to disputes with mills

---

### Page 9 — Kalapurna Mills Meter Report

**What it is:** A pre-printed form from **Kalapurna Mills** titled "METER REPORT." This is the mill's own measurement document that accompanies the lot.

**Header data:**
- Mill: Kalapurna Mills (with "Shri Mahaveeraya Namah" in Devanagari)
- Lot No: R.P-617
- Date: 18/1/2025
- Page: 12P5 (?)
- Qty: 148,000
- L.P. No: 0.62
- Values: 1082, 81, 1858

**Body:** Numbered rows 1-24 with two columns (Tayar Meter = Ready Meter):
- Row 1: 25
- Row 2: 130+
- Row 3: 12
- Row 4: 8950 (with note "LATIRL" — lateral?)
- Row 5: 63 (with "300x818")
- Row 6: 680 (with "308x148cm")
- Row 7: 644
- Row 8: 850
- Row 9: 67
- Row 10: 92
- Row 11: 105
- Row 12: 85
- Row 13: 65
- Bottom total area shows "79020" circled, and "19" circled

**Observations:**
- This is the **mill-side document** — it's what the dyeing mill sends along with the fabric
- "Tayar Meter" = "Ready Meter" in Hindi — the measurement after processing
- The meter report is what gets matched against RG Faith's own folding measurements (as seen in Page 8)
- "Kalapurna Mills" appears as a frequent supplier mill
- The form has the mill's own branding and structure — each mill likely has a different format
- Some entries mention dimensions (300x818, 308x148cm) — these could be roll/piece dimensions

---

### Page 10 — RG Faith Delivery Form (Outward)

**What it is:** A pre-printed **Delivery Form** from "RG Faith Creations Pvt. Ltd. / RAMGOPAL GIRDHARILAL / Shree Shubhlaxmi Textile Mills." Handwritten note at top says "RG gaucer" (possibly "RG gauser" — a person's name or department).

**Header data:**
- INWARD No: 065
- Date: 13/6/26 (wait — this date is in the future? Possibly 13/6/26 read wrong, or a different calendar)
- From/Firm: R.G. Faith Creations, Godown: Miroli
- Delivered to: P.M. Chhapti Tarat, Haste: Mohan Ram

**Body:**
| P/L | Bale No | Lot No | Trade No | SST Sec | Pcs/Kg/Samples | Mts |
|-----|---------|--------|----------|---------|----------------|-----|
| — | 1706/292 | 39 | PV-405 M=Toue | — | 38 | 4194 |

**Notes in Hindi:** "Maal mein US type ariyaan hain, ke kamal PP mila hai" (roughly: "The material has US-type defects/issues, and amazing PP was found")
- Reference: GOVT X-9196
- Total: 38 bales, 4194 (meters)

**Observations:**
- This is an **outward delivery form** — material leaving RG Faith's godown
- The entity names reveal the corporate structure: RG Faith Creations Pvt. Ltd. operates as Ramgopal Girdharilal / Shree Shubhlaxmi Textile Mills
- "Godown: Miroli" — confirms Miroli is a warehouse/godown
- The Hindi note mentions quality issues — this could be a return/reprocess shipment
- "Haste" = hand/custody — who the material is being handed to
- PV-405 could be a trade/product number
- 38 bales at 4194 meters = ~110 meters per bale average

---

### Page 11 — Packing Steps (Working Notes)

**What it is:** A handwritten working note titled "Packing Steps." This appears to be someone's personal notes about the packing process.

**Left side — Cutting specifications:**
- 7424: 43 01 43 | 48 01 48 | 38 01 38 | 35 01 35 | 28 01 28 | 26 01 26 | 33 01 33 | 36 01 36 | 24 01 24 | 09 311

**Right side — Product specs:**
- Bale No: 37432
- Width: 58"
- Brand: Sportsman
- Fold: Book 3 fold
- Tone: O1W
- Finish codes: 02, 01 Tone-A, 03 Tone-A

**Observations:**
- This shows the cutting pattern for a specific bale (37432)
- The left side lists individual piece lengths: 43m, 48m, 38m, 35m, 28m, 26m, 33m, 36m, 24m — totaling 311m with 09 pieces
- "01" in the middle column could be the count (1 piece each)
- "Book 3 fold" is a specific folding pattern — different from other folds
- "Sportsman" is a brand name assigned at packing
- "Finish" codes (01, 02, 03) with "Tone-A" — finishing specifications
- This directly maps to what the notes describe about packing orders specifying cut lengths and fold types

---

### Page 12 — RSK Industries Ready Goods Report ("Gate Pass")

**What it is:** A printed form from **RSK Industries Pvt. Ltd.** (168, Pirana Road, Piplaj, Ahmedabad - 100L) titled "Ready Goods Report." Handwritten title at top says "Gate Pass."

**Header:**
- Date: 18/1/206 (likely 18/1/2026)
- Pcs (Bales): 58
- Grey Mtr: 6822
- Quality: 44x45P6 (?)
- Lot No: 3402
- Ready Mtr: 628(1)
- GSM: 192
- P.O. No: —
- Shortage: -7,931
- Width: 58"
- Colour: —
- L.R. No: 96005x58
- Party: R.G. Faith

**Body:** Roll-by-roll measurement data:
| No | Roll No | Meter | Weight | ... |
|----|---------|-------|--------|-----|
| 1 | 111 | 11735 | 114 | ... |
| 2 | 112+ | 112 | 1060 | ... |
| ... continuing to 25 rows |

**Side annotations:**
- Grey: 6822
- Fresh Mtr: 628(1)
- Shinky: -7,931 (shortage/shrinkage)

**Observations:**
- RSK Industries is another supplier mill (different from Kalapurna)
- "Gate Pass" = this document serves as the exit authorization from the mill
- Grey Mtr 6822 vs Ready Mtr 6281 = ~8% shrinkage (noted as -7,931... but that seems too high — might be a different calculation)
- GSM 192 = fabric weight specification (grams per square meter)
- 58 pieces/bales in this lot
- This is the **mill-side** document that travels with the goods
- "Party: R.G. Faith" confirms this is destined for RG Faith

---

### Page 13 — RG Faith Packing Program (Form 1)

**What it is:** A pre-printed "Packing Program" form from **RG Faith Creations Pvt Ltd.** MRL No: 1782.

**Header:**
- Date: 6/11/26 (likely 6/11/2025 or calendar difference)
- Process House: Kalapurna
- Lot No: 775
- Pcs: 5 (Bales)
- Mtrs: 5688
- Shrinkage: 5-12
- Product: Uniform (Blue) / (Sober)
- Width: 1497M (likely 149 CM)
- Whiteness: O1W

**Body — Packing instructions:**
"Folding and Tapewise - Finish wale cutting"

**Cutting No (1) (22 yrs?):**
1. Folding: Fold SSTM, Brand: Officer, Trade: 250 01 250, Haste: Rame Sample in Bale — 58" (21/22 MTR Cut)
2. Same fold/brand: RG Special, 350 01 350, CB — (22 MTR Cut)
3. Same: Sportsman, 350 01 350, VS — (20 MTR Cut)
4. Same: KT-11058, 250 02 700, 1 SIR L.K.Soul — (25 to 30 MTR Cut)
5. Roof/Fold 881018: SSTM, KT-11058, 350, 05, 1750, Jay Shree — (30 MTR Cut)

**Cutting No (2) (18 yrs?):**
6. 2Fold SSTM: DDT-58", 250 02 700, MM
7. Roof (Select): (150/30 MTR Cut)
8. Still cutting No (3) — 114 Mtr Add Rs.1

**Observations:**
- This is the **Packing Program** — the master instruction document for how to process a lot
- It specifies: which lot, how to cut, which brand to stamp, fold type, and trade stamping
- Multiple brands get applied to the SAME incoming lot: Officer, RG Special, Sportsman, KT-11058, DDT-58"
- "SSTM" appears repeatedly — likely "Shree Shubhlaxmi Textile Mills" stamp
- "Haste" names (Rame, CB, VS, L.K.Soul, Jay Shree) — these might be customer destinations or sales agents
- "Roof" fold vs regular "Fold" — different folding methods
- The same raw material becomes different branded products depending on cutting and folding specs — this matches the notes perfectly
- Cutting lengths vary: 20, 21/22, 22, 25-30, 30 MTR cuts

---

### Page 14 — RG Faith Packing Program (Form 2)

**What it is:** Another Packing Program form. Lot pending range: 37427 to 37431. Chalet: 4.86.

- Width: 1497M
- Shrinkage: 4.26
- Whiteness: O1W

**Instructions:**
"Folding and Tapewise - Finish wale cutting"

**Cutting No (1) (A-Tape):** 8/1628 MTR, "Good cut only!"

**Cutting No (2):** A-Tape + Cutting(1) (B-Tape) + Cutting(3)
- 3/230 MTR + 494 MTR + 2/302 MTR

**Cutting No (3) - (A-Tape):**
- MRL 1903 — reference to another lot to be added
- "Baaki Punch" (remaining balance)

**Observations:**
- More complex packing program with multiple cutting numbers and tape types (A-Tape, B-Tape)
- A-Tape and B-Tape seem to be edge/selvedge designations or roll positions
- Cross-references MRL 1903 — lots can be combined in a single packing program
- "Good cut only!" — quality instruction
- "Packing slip at Ropean Cream field" — specific packing instructions mentioning a location/brand
- "Baaki Punch" = remaining balance — indicates this is a partial processing instruction
- "GLC + Print" — additional finishing instructions (possibly logo/brand printing)

---

### Page 15 — RG Faith Packing Program (Form 3)

**What it is:** Another Packing Program. Lot pending range: 37432 to 37435. Chalet: 5.57. MRL No: 1903.

**Observations:**
- References multiple MRLs (1902, 1903, 1864) being combined
- Shrinkage noted as 8.57% — higher than the 5-12% range in Form 1
- Complex cutting instructions with A, B, C sub-categories
- "Equal Fita 51 MTR" — Fita could be ribbon/tape-like cuts
- Bottom calculations appear to be yield/waste reconciliation
- "China" mention — possibly a customer or grade designation
- "Instruction given by: 70" — coded reference to who authorized

---

### Page 16 — Gradation Report (Computer-Generated)

**What it is:** A printed "Gradation Report" from **RG Faith Creations Pvt. Ltd.** for a "Folding Jobwork Bill." Handwritten date: 10/11/26.

| Total | | | | | 6,006.80 | 5,826.00 | 5,825.00 | 5,644.33 | 5,644.33 |

**Shrinkage progression:**
- Grey U/S: 6,006.80
- Gate Pass: 5,826.00 (difference: ~180 meters / ~3%)
- F.H. Avak (Folding House Arrival): 5,825.00
- F.H. Fold (After Folding): 5,644.33
- F.H. Plk (After Packing): 5,644.33

**Gradation breakdown:**
| Gradation | Kg/Pcs | Mtrs | % | @Loss% | Loss% |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fresh | — | 5,470.02 | 96.91% | 0.00% | 0.00% |
| Good Cut | — | 52 | 0.92% | 0.00% | — |
| Fent | 11.46 | 64.44 | 1.14% | 50.06% | 0.58% |
| Rags | — | 6.48 | 0.15% | 0.00% | — |
| Chindi | 2.00 | 16.82 | 0.35% | 100.00% | 0.35% |

**Non-Fresh %: 3.08%** | **Re-Process noted: 19.32, 3.47%**

**Observations:**
- This is the KEY document — the **Gradation Report** shows the complete yield analysis
- Shows the full meter loss progression: Grey (6006) -> Gate Pass (5826) -> Arrival (5825) -> Folded (5644) -> Packed (5644)
- 96.91% Fresh yield is considered good
- The grades match notes exactly: Fresh, Good Cut, Fent, Rags, Chindi
- Loss% is tracked per grade — Chindi is 100% loss, Fent is 50% loss
- Bill amount (3,387) at rate 0.60 — this is the folding jobwork charge
- "KT-11000" product code tracked from grey through finish
- This is a computer-generated report — they DO have some software already
- The program reference (#MRL-60986) ties back to the MRL tracking system

- Case No ML 26-34804 maps to Bale No 37143 (handwritten)
- "HASTE-DELHI FINSH-2 BOOK FOLD" — destination is Delhi, finish type 2, book fold
- 342 meters in 6 pieces matches the bale label (Page 18)
- "Blended Fabric" is the product description
- The handwritten notes add details the system doesn't capture: format (230), exact cut length (20 metro), new bale number
- There's a gap between what the computer system tracks and what the workers need — hence the handwritten additions

- Product: KT-11000 (96.0152, Bluebird)
- Mtrs: 8785
- Shrinkage: 1.07
- Width: 89 CM
- Whiteness: O1W

**Instructions:**
"Roof Folding Tape wise - Finish wale cutting, Fold (H4d)"

**Cutting No (1) (14 yrs?):**
1. B1F SSTM KT-No-one 500 01 500 P.C.
2. B1F SSTM KT-555 500 02 1000 N.M.

5. B1F SSTM KT-11000 500 MTR Packing (H4d)

**Waste calculations:**
- Fent/Chindi breakdown
- 7500/8-4000
- 8-5001/90.44
- 1-000/qty
- 3-200/roll form
- Various calculations leading to: 5558 (meters to pack), 166.99 Fent, 20.44 Chindi, 50 Good cut, 57,955.43 total
- 19,600 and 166.99 noted

**Observations:**
- "Lot Complete" indicates this is a fully processed lot
- KT-11000 product with "Bluebird" — another brand name
- "B1F" fold type — different from Book fold and Roof fold
- Multiple brand stampings from same lot: KT-No-one, KT-555, Diamond, KT-21000, KT-11000
- Destinations: P.C., N.M., Agra, Amit — these are customer/destination codes
- "H4d" — a specific fold/format code
- Shrinkage only 1.07% — much lower than the Uniform fabric
- Width 89 CM (~36") — this is a 36" product vs the 58" uniforms
- Detailed waste tracking at bottom

### Page 21 — Cutting/Packing Tally Sheet (Finish Tracking)

**What it is:** A handwritten tally sheet tracking the cutting and packing across multiple "Finish" runs. Title shows "(A) Finish" and "(B) Finish" sections, plus a third section labeled "10P11000 Hyd."

**Content — (A) Finish:**
- Columns: CT.No, NDMI/KT-555, 10F11000, with piece counts
- Rows showing paired numbers (pieces x length): 1x2, 40x6, 240, 3011, 25, 19, 24, 30
- Running totals: T41503, T4155

**(B) Finish:**
- Columns: R009, Amit/Diamond, KT-21000/KT-11000
- Similar paired number structure
- Totals: T41500, P1508

**Third section — 10P11000 Hyd:**
- Similar structure with running totals
- T41501, T41508, T4526
- Notes: "30" entries, T41531

**Bottom right:**
- Lot: 7945
- 0866 (?)
- O1W
- D1W0561
- "8 Bale Thaan Adjustment" — adjustment of 8 bales
- Total: 5558

**Observations:**
- This tracks the actual cutting/packing execution against the packing program
- Multiple "Finish" runs (A, B, and Hyd) for the same lot
- "Hyd" likely = Hyderabad (a destination)
- "T41503" etc. are likely case/bale tracking numbers
- "Bale Thaan Adjustment" — "Thaan" is a textile industry term for a piece/roll of fabric
- The numbers match the 5558 total from Page 20 — this is the execution record for that packing program
- Shows how one lot gets split across multiple brand/finish combinations and destinations

## Part 2: Notes.md Summary

The notes describe the full RG Faith process:

1. **Raw material in:** Threads/yarns arrive, go through weaving (in-house), then sent out for dyeing (job work)
2. **Scope starts:** When dyed cloth returns as semi-finished goods
3. **Inbound tracking:** Truck arrives with reference doc, meters tracked, partial shipments common
4. **Folding (Station 1):** Every meter gets folded, first measurement recorded
5. **Quality grading:** Fresh, Cut, Fent, Rags, Chindi, Not Acceptable
6. **Not acceptable:** Separated, stored, sent back (conflict resolution)
7. **Packing order:** Based on sales order — specifies lengths, pieces, fold type
8. **Branding at packing:** Raw material gets brand name only when packed; SKU depends on cut+fold config
9. **Bale = final unit:** Cardboard box with plastic layers, stickers, brand stamps, thread wrapping
10. **Leftover sorting:** Small quantities baled separately (Chindi, Fresh Cut, Rags)
11. **Toria:** When leftover bales accumulate enough volume, they're broken down and repacked for sale
12. **Packaging materials:** Vendors supply; GRN with invoice; no purchase system wanted, just inward tracking
13. **Samples:** Cut from main material but with different packaging and brochure imprinting

## Part 4: Terminology Needing Clarification

| # | Term | Where Found | Best Guess | Confidence | Question |
|---|------|-------------|------------|------------|----------|
| 1 | **MRL No** | Pages 2,3,6,7,13-16,20 | **RESOLVED:** MRL = Miroli (RG Faith's facility). MRL No is a **round-trip tracking number** — assigned by RG Faith when sending goods OUT to a vendor for dyeing. When the vendor returns the dyed cloth, they reference the same MRL No. This links outgoing grey cloth to returning dyed cloth. It is NOT an inbound receipt number — it's created at the outbound-to-vendor stage. | High | ~~What does MRL stand for?~~ Fully resolved. |
| 2 | **Avak Date** | Pages 2,3,6,7 | Arrival/receipt date at Miroli (Hindi: "avak" = incoming) | High | Confirm this is the date material physically arrived at Miroli |
| 3 | **Miroli** | Pages 3,4,6,7,10 | **RESOLVED:** Miroli is RG Faith's entire facility — folding, grading, packing, and dispatch all happen here. "MRL No" is the Miroli inbound lot number. | High | ~~Is Miroli the only processing location?~~ Confirmed as the entire facility. |
| 4 | **O1W** | Nearly every page | **RESOLVED:** O1W = Off-White. Tone codes are user-defined — the system should allow RG Faith to create/manage their own tone codes. Other examples seen: Rust/BMQ, L-03, OAV, Blue, White. | High | ~~Are there other tone codes?~~ Resolved: system will provide configurable tone code master. |
| 5 | **SSTM** | Pages 13,14,15,20 | **RESOLVED:** SSTM = Shree Shubhlaxmi Textile Mills — a brand name under RG Faith Creations Pvt. Ltd. (the company). ~90% of output is SSTM but there could be other brands. System should support: Company > Brand (configurable) > Product (configurable). Product names (Officer, Diamond, Sportsman, etc.) sit under a brand. | High | ~~Is SSTM always stamped?~~ Resolved. Brands and products will be user-configurable. |
| 6 | **Haste** | Pages 10,13,17,18,19 | **RESOLVED:** Haste = "for [party name]" — indicates which party/customer the goods are destined for. E.g., "Haste: Mohan Ram" = packed/shipped for Mohan Ram. Essentially the customer or buyer assignment on a bale. | High | ~~Is Haste a customer, agent, or destination?~~ Resolved: it's the customer/party. |
| 7 | **Toria / Todiya** | Notes, Page 17 | **RESOLVED:** Toria (possibly spelled Todiya) = "breaking" in Hindi/Gujarati. Originally referred to physically breaking open bales for repacking. Now more of a software/accounting operation — reassigning inventory. Page 17's "Toshika ki Todiya khaata" = Toshika's Todiya account (inventory reassignment ledger for that party). Spelling TBD. | High | ~~How does Toria differ from normal packing?~~ Resolved: it's an inventory reassignment operation, mostly in system now. |
| 8 | **Thaan** | Page 21 | **RESOLVED:** Thaan = a piece of fabric. Standard textile industry term. Same as "piece" in their system. "8 Bale Thaan Adjustment" = adjusting 8 bales worth of pieces. | High | ~~Is a Thaan the same as a "piece"?~~ Resolved: yes. |
| 9 | **B1F** | Page 20 | **RESOLVED:** A fold type. System should allow users to define their own fold types. Known examples: B1F, Book fold, Book 3 fold, Roof fold, 2Fold, H4d. | High | ~~What are all the fold types?~~ Resolved: fold types will be user-configurable. |
| 10 | **Roof fold** | Pages 13,14,15,20 | **RESOLVED:** A fold type — see #9. All fold types are user-configurable. | High | ~~What does Roof fold look like?~~ Resolved: not needed for system design. |
| 11 | **A-Tape / B-Tape** | Pages 14,15 | **RESOLVED:** A-Tape, B-Tape, C are just labels to distinguish multiple packing programs written on the same physical sheet. What appears as "Cutting No 1, 2, 3" on one page are actually **separate packing programs**. Page 14 is specifically a **Todiya packing program** — for accumulated leftover inventory (not fresh goods) that has found a buyer. System should model these as separate packing program records. | High | ~~What is the distinction?~~ Resolved: labels for separate packing programs on same sheet. |
| 12 | **Gate Pass** | Pages 12,16 | **RESOLVED:** The Gate Pass (page 12) is the **inbound reference document from the mill** that comes with the truck. Standard format across all mills. Contains: lot no, grey meters, roll-by-roll data, quality, GSM, width, shrinkage. On arrival it's just filed — no verification or rejection. Referenced later when folding/inspection begins. Mill's grey meter count is trusted at face value. Page 16's "Gate Pass Mtrs" is just a column referencing the meters from this document. | High | ~~Is Gate Pass the reference document?~~ Resolved: yes. Trusted, filed on arrival, referenced at folding. |
| 12a | **Chadat / Chaddat** | Page 16, note_2.md | **NEW TERM (from note_2):** A conversion unit between metres and kilograms for a specific lot. Fresh and Good Cut are measured in metres; Fent, Rags, and Chindi are measured in kilograms. Chadat bridges metres and kg for Fent, Rags, and Chindi. Calculated for each lot. Used to determine grade percentages and track loss. | High | How is Chadat calculated? Is it a fixed ratio per lot or does it vary by grade? |
| 12b | **Gradation Report (progressive)** | Page 16, note_2.md | **NEW INSIGHT (from note_2):** The Gradation Report is a progressive/running report, not a one-time snapshot. It reflects only the portion of a lot that has been processed so far. Updates as more of the lot moves through grading. For a 6,000m lot with 4,000m processed, the report covers only those 4,000m. | High | Does the system need to show historical snapshots of the gradation report, or just the latest state? |
| 13 | **Chalet** | Pages 14,15 | **RESOLVED:** Misread handwriting — this is actually **Chadat** (see #12a). Values like 4.86 and 5.37 are the meters-to-kg conversion factor for that lot. Appears on Packing Program headers. | High | ~~What is a Chalet?~~ Resolved: it's Chadat. |
| 14 | **GLC / G/C** | Pages 14,15 | **RESOLVED:** Misread handwriting — this is **G/C = Good Cut**. "G/C + Fent" means mix Good Cut and Fent together in the bale. This aligns with these being Todiya packing programs where leftover grades are combined for a buyer. | High | ~~What does GLC stand for?~~ Resolved: Good Cut. |
| 15 | **Fita** | Page 15 | **RESOLVED:** Likely a misread of handwriting — probably **Fent**. No term "Fita" exists in their process. | Medium | ~~Is Fita a product type?~~ Resolved: misread, likely Fent. |
| 16 | **H4d / Hyd** | Page 20 | **RESOLVED:** Misread handwriting — this is **Hyd = Hyderabad**, likely indicating the customer or destination. Not a fold type. Also matches page 21 where "Hyd" appears as a destination column. | High | ~~What numbering system?~~ Resolved: it's a city/destination abbreviation. |
| 17 | **Font/Sel.** | Page 3 | **RESOLVED:** Just a remark on a decision-pending lot — specific meaning doesn't matter for system design. Key insight: every decision-pending lot should have a **remark field** and a **resolution pipeline** in the system. | High | ~~Is this a single grade?~~ Resolved: it's a free-text remark. System needs remark + resolution workflow for pending lots. |
| 18 | **Coolking** | Page 7 | **RESOLVED:** Likely misread, but regardless it's a **quality parameter of the incoming semi-finished good** (not the finished product). These quality codes (KT-11000, Lancer, Liverpool, etc.) describe the cloth arriving from the mill. User-configurable in the system. Important distinction: inbound quality code ≠ outbound brand/product name. | High | ~~Is this a mill product line?~~ Resolved: inbound semi-finished goods quality, user-configurable. |
| 19 | **GSM** | Page 12 | **RESOLVED:** GSM = Grams per Square Meter (fabric weight/density). But the bigger design point: the system should support **configurable SKU attributes** — not hardcode GSM or any specific attribute. Users should be able to define which attributes to track (GSM, width, tone, quality, shrinkage, etc.) and attach them to SKUs. This applies to both inbound semi-finished goods and outbound finished products. | High | ~~Is GSM tracked?~~ Resolved: system needs configurable attribute framework for SKUs. |
| 20 | **Case No vs Bale No** | Pages 4,17,19 | **RESOLVED:** Two different reference numbers from two different systems — head office tracking (Case No) vs factory floor tracking (Bale No). Both refer to the same physical bale. Legacy artifact of separate systems. Our system will use its own unified reference — no need to replicate this dual numbering. Page 19 packing slip: one copy goes inside the bale physically. | High | ~~Why two numbering systems?~~ Resolved: legacy dual-system issue. We'll use our own unified reference. |

## Part 5: Questions for the Team

### Process Flow Questions

1. ~~**What exactly happens at "Miroli"?**~~ **RESOLVED:** Miroli is the entire facility. All processing happens here — folding, grading, packing, dispatch.

2. ~~**How many processing stations are there physically?**~~ **RESOLVED:** Open area with no physically marked stations. Space allocation is fluid — processes expand/contract based on season, peak time, and workload. No fixed station layout.

3. ~~**What is the timeline from inbound to dispatch?**~~ **RESOLVED:** Most lots are dispatched within a week. Decision-pending lots are the exception — they sit for long periods (sometimes 1+ years) because no one knows what to do with them. This is a pain point the system's resolution pipeline should help address (aging alerts, escalation, etc.).

4. ~~**Who creates the Packing Program?**~~ **RESOLVED:** Created by the head supervisor or facility manager. Triggered by a sales order — they work out the math for how to cut/fold/pack the available lot to meet the dispatch requirements. The system could assist with this calculation.

5. ~~**How does the "not acceptable" conflict resolution work?**~~ **RESOLVED:** No formal process. Works like an open issue — back and forth commentary between RG Faith and the mill. Usually the vendor arranges pickup of the rejected quantity. If not, it just stays at the facility. No credit notes or money involved. System should model this as a simple issue/ticket workflow: open → commentary → resolved (picked up) or unresolved (stays).

6. ~~**What is the Toria process in detail?**~~ **RESOLVED:** Toria/Todiya = inventory reassignment, now mostly a software operation. Todiya packing programs (e.g., page 14) are created when accumulated leftovers find a buyer. G/C and Fent can be mixed together.

### Inventory & Tracking Questions

7. ~~**How are MRL numbers assigned?**~~ **RESOLVED:** MRL = Miroli facility lot number. Exact legacy numbering scheme unknown. System will implement its own numbering — to be designed later.

8. ~~**What is the relationship between Lot Number, MRL Number, and Bale Number?**~~ **RESOLVED:** Three distinct identifiers: **MRL Number** = assigned by RG Faith when sending goods OUT to vendor for dyeing. It's a round-trip tracking number — vendor references it when returning the dyed cloth. Links outgoing grey cloth to returning dyed cloth. **Lot Number** = vendor's own identifier, generated by the vendor. Sticks with the material through all downstream processes at RG Faith. **Bale Number** = assigned at packing time for finished goods. Flow: MRL (outbound to vendor) → Lot No (vendor's reference, returns with goods) → Bale No (assigned at packing).

9. ~~**Where does the grey meter count come from?**~~ **RESOLVED:** From the mill's Gate Pass. Trusted at face value, no re-verification on arrival.

10. ~~**How is shrinkage handled commercially?**~~ **RESOLVED:** No penalties or incentives for vendors — trusted relationships. Shrinkage is tracked for visibility only. Strategic decisions based on the data happen infrequently. Two key loss metrics captured in the Gradation Report: (1) **Shrinkage** — grey meters vs finished meters, (2) **Non-fresh loss** — any meters graded as Good Cut, Fent, Rags, or Chindi instead of Fresh. The Gradation Report is the central metrics document for the semi-finished → finished goods process.

11. ~~**What system are they using for the computer-generated reports?**~~ **RESOLVED:** Factory has NO system — fully paper-based. Head office has a custom ERP but it's out of scope. We are building a **completely independent system** for the factory. Any data exchange with the head office ERP will be handled via import/export utility (to be designed later). **KEY PROJECT SCOPE CLARIFICATION:** The system is an **inventory tracking system** for the factory. Three inventory types: (1) Grey material inventory, (2) Packaging material inventory, (3) Grey material inventory at each processing stage (grey → finished). Track: what stage, how much, quantity in meters or kg. **No financial data tracking.**

12. ~~**How do they reconcile "Part Pending" lots?**~~ **RESOLVED:** The MRL number records how many meters were originally sent to the vendor. When the first shipment returns, the system should calculate pending meters (sent minus received). Most of the time one shipment covers the full MRL. Occasionally there's a second shipment for the remainder. System needs: total meters sent per MRL, meters received per shipment, auto-calculated pending balance.

### Product & Branding Questions

13. ~~**How many brand names does RG Faith use?**~~ **RESOLVED:** Brands and products are user-configurable. Company (RG Faith) > Brand (SSTM ~90%, others possible) > Product (Officer, Diamond, etc.).

14. ~~**What determines which brand/product a piece gets?**~~ **RESOLVED:** No fixed rules or BOM-style mapping. Brand/product assignment is entirely at the discretion of the facility manager when creating the Packing Program. Any lot can be assigned to any brand/product. The system should NOT enforce lot-to-brand rules — just allow free assignment at packing time.

15. ~~**What is the difference between "Trade No" and "Brand Stamping"?**~~ **RESOLVED:** Two separate things. **Brand Stamping** = the brand (e.g., SSTM / Shree Shubhlaxmi). **Trade No** = the finished product SKU reference (e.g., S8072-58", KT-11000). So a bale gets stamped with a brand AND assigned a trade number that identifies the specific product SKU.

16. ~~**Are the widths (36" and 58") the only sizes?**~~ **RESOLVED:** Width is just one of many configurable SKU attributes — no special process differences based on width. **KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLE:** Build an open, configurable system first. Each SKU can have many attributes, and entities (folds, grades, etc.) could have validations added later. Start unconstrained, then progressively tighten with business rules over time.

17. ~~**What are all the fold types and when is each used?**~~ **RESOLVED:** Fold types are user-configurable. Known examples: Book fold, Book 3 fold, Roof fold, 2Fold, B1F.

### Operations Questions

18. ~~**How many people work at each station?**~~ **RESOLVED:** 2-3 people at each station minimum, up to 6-7 at busy stations. Staffing is flexible based on workload. Implies multi-user access needed — several workers may need to record data simultaneously.

19. ~~**What is the daily/monthly throughput?**~~ **RESOLVED:** Factory capacity is **1.4 crore meters per year** (14 million meters / ~14,000 km). That's roughly 1.17 lakh meters per month or ~3,800 meters per day. System needs to handle this scale comfortably.

20. ~~**How are the Hindi remarks on forms captured?**~~ **RESOLVED:** Currently no intermediate process data is digitized — only aggregated outputs at start/end of process. Not a concern for now. RG Faith is open to us recommending what new data points the system should capture and what paper-based steps become redundant once the system is in place.

21. ~~**What packaging materials are tracked?**~~ **RESOLVED:** All packaging materials are tracked. Each has specific SKUs and associated vendors. System needs: configurable packaging material SKUs, vendor master for packaging suppliers, inward tracking (quantity received from vendor), and consumption tracking (quantity used during packing).

22. ~~**How do samples differ from regular bales?**~~ **RESOLVED:** No separate process flow. Samples are specified within the Packing Program itself — the manager notes whether a sample is required and what packaging SKU to use (brochure, booklet, etc.). System should support sample instructions as part of the Packing Program record.

## Part 6: Gaps and Missing Information

### Not Covered in Either Scans or Notes

1. **Weaving process** — Out of scope per notes, but we should confirm the boundary
2. **Dyeing job work** — Out of scope, but the interface (sending out / receiving back) needs documentation
3. **Sales order creation** — How orders come in, who creates them, what system
4. **Customer master** — Who are the customers? How are "Haste" destinations managed?
5. **Pricing** — How are products priced? The stock report (Page 4) shows Rate/Amount as 0.00
6. **Returns from customers** — What happens if a customer rejects a bale?
7. **Transportation/logistics** — How are deliveries arranged? Who handles freight?
8. **Accounting integration** — How does inventory feed into financials?
9. **Vendor/mill master** — Full list of mills and their product capabilities
10. **Quality specifications** — What defines each grade? What are the measurable criteria for Fresh vs Fent vs Cut vs Rags vs Chindi?

### Covered in Notes but Not in Scans

1. **Packaging material inward/GRN process** — Notes describe it but no sample form was scanned
2. **Toria process** — Described in notes but no form/document example
3. **Sample preparation process** — Mentioned but no example

### Covered in Scans but Not in Notes

1. **Multiple mills as suppliers** — Kalapurna, RSK, PSJC, ATP, BKT, Shaim, Shyam, Shreeji, Om Shakthi
2. **Computer-generated reports** — Notes don't mention existing software
3. **Multiple brand names** — Notes mention branding generally but scans show 15+ distinct brands
4. **A-Tape/B-Tape/C cutting categories** — Complex cutting hierarchy not described in notes
5. **Fold type specifications** — Multiple fold types not detailed in notes
6. **Meter reconciliation process** — Folding meters vs factory meters matching
7. **Gradation report with yield analysis** — Detailed percentage-based grading not described in notes

## Part 7: Initial Understanding — Process Flow (Draft)

```
MILL (Kalapurna, RSK, etc.)
  |
  | Gate Pass / Meter Report / Ready Goods Report
  v
INBOUND at MIROLI
  |
  | Assign MRL No, record Avak Date, reference Lot No
  v
FOLDING STATION
  |
  | Unfold, measure, record Folding Meters
  | Match against Mill's Factory Meters
  v
QUALITY GRADING
  |
  |---> Fresh (96%+) ---------> PACKING PROGRAM
  |---> Good Cut -------------> PACKING PROGRAM (or accumulate)
  |---> Fent -----------------> Accumulate for Toria
  |---> Rags -----------------> Accumulate for Toria
  |---> Chindi ---------------> Accumulate for Toria (100% loss)
  |---> Not Acceptable -------> REPROCESS LIST (send back to mill)
  |---> Decision Pending -----> HOLD (waiting for grading)
  v
PACKING PROGRAM (created per sales order)
  |
  | Specifies: lot, cutting lengths, fold type, brand stamps,
  |            trade numbers, destinations (Haste)
  v
CUTTING & PACKING
  |
  | Cut to specified lengths
  | Fold per specification (Book, Roof, B1F, etc.)
  | Apply brand stamp (SSTM + brand name)
  | Package: plastic layer, stickers, cardboard box, thread
  | Assign Bale No
  v
PACKED BALE (= finished good)
  |
  | Packing Slip generated (computer system)
  | Bale Label attached
  v
DISPATCH
