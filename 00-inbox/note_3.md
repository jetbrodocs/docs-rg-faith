We have two new points.

First, the terminology of "roll" isn't always accurate. They also use the term "lump." A roll is a roll of cloth, as the name suggests. A lump is just a badly folded piece of cloth. We need to find terminology that works for both, but they refer to it as raw roll sometimes and as lump other times.

Second, they need to be able to change the tone and finish classification at later stages as well, but only if they have authorization.
