We had a second meeting with the client and there are significant changes to incorporate. I'll go through them one by one. We'll need to revise our observations, analysis, process maps, and solution designs. If you want to do a Q&A session after this, I'm open to that.

Here are the changes:

-> First, the MRL number is not an outbound number. It's the inward number.

-> Second, what goes outbound is called Gray, and what comes back inbound is called finished material. So the terminology is: Gray is what we send to vendors, and finished is what comes back. And in reality its "greige" which client is happy to use

-> Once the GRN is complete for the inward, an MRL number is generated. We've been told that every number should have FY as a prefix. There should be a system for code generation.

-> The first thing that happens with the inward is fold. This is the most normal thing they do for each roll that comes in. The inward is happening of a lot, and that lot has multiple rolls in it. Rolls have meters that come in the inward, which vendors have specified.

What these guys do is fold, usually by 95 centimeters. Then they do a simple meter check.

While doing this, they also send a sample to the head office. That sample comes back, and then they have tone and grade set for that particular roll or lot. It's possible that multiple rolls have the same tone and grade, or one roll might have one tone and another roll a different one.

--> With the folding instruction comes a reference to one of the scans. That's where we didn't read it correctly.

Here's what happens. There's a folding instruction and sometimes packing instructions. Many times only folding instructions are given. Other times both are provided together.

A folding instruction specifies what kind of folds you want. Book fold or another type. It's just the way the cloth is folded.

A packing instruction covers how you want the material cut, meaning at what distance or length. It also includes how many bales should be created.

The exact number of bales specified isn't mandatory. For example, the instruction might say create three bales, but depending on how production actually happened, you might create two instead.

--- below are all other draft notes ---

- mrl no is not outbound, grey challan no, mrl no. its inbound

- add inward no. for inward packaging goods (GRN)

- add FY infront of all codes, make system for code generation, have vendor codes and customer codes 

- multiple types of folds happen, so folding instructions have to be given (folding instructions missing) -- not necessary 1m or 2m

- greige > finished metres > folded > graded > packed

- create folding instrcution

- no outbound record required 

- Folding & measurement and tone finish classification (4 & 5, 5 after 4) > Sample sent to office from factory > Packing instructions (packing instructions could be )

- Merging of two lots at folding

- roll scan and then put on table >> packing is cut + fold >> output is thaan or roll (entry, thapi) >> bale setting system 

- log chadat anytime (has to be before gradation)

- bale reg for non-fresh

- pickup scheduled and dispatched

- packaging material to be 

--- below are notes by my team member from the same team ---

L.R. No. - Outward job number / Outward No. - Greige Challan number
M.R.L. No. - Inward unique number.

Packaging material-
Inward number - to add. (helps for tracking - stock)

Serializing and logic for Inward Lot number - year and vendor code embedded

Types of fold - Given Folding instructions/program
Create folding instruction- type of fold (7 or 8, length of fold (standard 100 cm and can be changed)

After Folding:
add new step- Rough Inspection> Tone Finish classification and meters of each.
(all tone sample sent to offc with data - tone 1- x meters, tone 2 - y meters, etc.)

packaging breakdown -
rolls convert into thaan - log the thaan in to the system for inventory tracking.

Gradation happens parallely with the thaan
