Alright, I'm going to walk through the full process at RG Faith. What they do, how it works. This will be a bit long.

RG Faith's end product is white cotton cloth, rolled and folded into bundles for sale. That's the core of what they do. They have other products, but 90% is white cloth. The rest follows the same model: ready cloth rolled into packs. Their customers are mostly B2B, so they only take large orders.

Now, the process. They run two processes in-house and one outside. First, they get threads and yarns, both horizontal and main yarn. Those go into the weaving machine, which produces the first cloth. That cloth then goes out for dyeing as job work. Once it comes back, there's a full set of processes that take it from there to finished goods.

Our scope starts when the cloth comes back from dyeing. So we're working from semi-finished goods to finished product, ready for dispatch to customers.


Let's start with inbound semi-finished goods. When material comes in, we're tracking everything. That includes both the packaging material and the main semi-finished goods.

First, the semi-finished goods. A truck arrives with a reference document listing what was originally sent out for dyeing and what's now being returned. Everything is measured in meters. For example, we might have sent 6,000 meters but only receive 4,000 meters back. The remaining 2,000 could still be in process. Material comes back in partial shipments as it gets processed.

Our job is to capture this at intake. Each incoming batch already has a reference number tied to the original stock that was sent out.

So once it comes in, it's not measured immediately. It's just taken in. There's no rejection at this stage. We just have the reference number.

The first process is folding. No matter what comes in, the team at the first station folds it. Every meter gets a fold. That's when they first check the measurement and record how many meters it is.

After that, a quality check happens. They check how much of the lot is good or bad, then grade it. The grades are:

- Fresh grade (good quality)
- Four other grades: cut, fent, rags, and chindi
- Not acceptable grade

The not acceptable part gets cut from the fabric. We need to store that cut inventory separately because RG Fade needs to send it back to them. There's a conflict resolution process for that, we can talk about it later.

For the part that is good, it gets checked and folded again, then given a grade: fresh, cut, fent, rags, or chindi.

Once this is done, the packing order is given.

In the packing order process, here's what currently happens. Based on the sales order, a packing order is issued. The packing order is a guide that specifies how much fabric to cut, in what lengths, and how many pieces. For example, if the order is for 1000 meters and they want it cut into 100 meter lengths, the packing order will specify 10 lots of 100 meters each.

Once the packing order is issued, the team starts cutting, packing, and baling the fabric into boxes.

The raw material doesn't have a brand name assigned to it initially. The finished goods get a brand name only when they're packed. The way the material is packed, folded, and cut becomes part of the final product definition. So the final product SKUs depend on the specific cut and fold configuration.

The final packed product is called a bale, which is essentially a box. There's quite a bit of packaging material involved. For each fold, they add a plastic layer. Then there are stickers, brand stamping, and packaging inside the cardboard box. They also use threads wrapped around the cardboard box to secure and tighten it.

Any leftover material gets sorted into Chindi stock, fresh cut, or rags. These quantities are small, so they're baled but not immediately ready for sale.

Once enough volume accumulates, the sales team arranges a sale. Then the bale gets broken down again, which they call Toria, and repacked based on what the customer needs.

Two more things here.

First is packaging materials. Vendors are called to send packaging material. The material arrives with an invoice. There's a GRN with invoice. They don't want a purchase system. They just want to record the inward of material that comes in and the quantity, both to track inventory and to track when quantities are being used for packaging.


Second, samples. Because the orders are large, customers also request samples with each order. The buyers want sample material on top of their main order so they can use it to sell downstream.

Samples are a type of cut, but they also require different packaging and brochure imprinting.
