The gradation report tells the whole story. One thing I missed is the chadat, spelled C H A D A T. You'll see "chadat" written in Gujarati or Hindi in other scans too.

chadat is a conversion unit between meters and kilograms for the specific lot covered by the gradation report. Fresh cut is always measured in meters. Everything else, good cut, fent, rags, or chindi, is measured in kilograms. *(Correction: Good Cut is also measured in metres. Only Fent, Rags, and Chindi are in kilograms. Chadat is used for Fent, Rags, and Chindi only.)*

During cutting and buzzing, they calculate this conversion for a particular patch or lot and mark it as chaddat. They need the chaddat to figure out what percentage of the received lot was fresh cut versus good cut, fent, rags, and chindi. It also helps them track how much loss happened in backing or forwarding.

The next important thing to understand is that the gradation report is a progressive report. What I mean by that is, let's say the lot received was around 6,000 meters. But in the process they found that 1,000 meters were not good, or they've only processed 4,000 meters so far. Then the gradation report should show how much progress has been made on the original lot, and the report itself should only cover the portion of the lot that has actually gone through the process up to whatever stage it's reached.
